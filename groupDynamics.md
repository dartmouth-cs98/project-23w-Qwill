## I. Communication
*You are required to spend at least 10 hours/week outside of class. Outline a general weekly meeting schedule with at least 1 time that everybody can make. That one meeting must include the entire team in the same room, in person. The rest of the 10 hours may be split into several sessions throughout the week. A nice tool for this is [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/).*

### Schedule
* ZOOM at 3:30 on Mondays
* The green at 4:30 on Thursdays
* Place at Time on Day
* Place at Time on Day

### Responsiveness
*How often should team members be expected to check and respond on Slack?*

## II. Decision Making

### Group
*What types of decisions need to be discussed and approved by the entire group?*

### Individual
*What types of decisions can be made by a single person?*

## III. Conflict Resolution
There are three main types of conflict that tend to occur in group projects:

* **Creative differences**: disagreement on any decisions related to the product
* **Personal differences**: friction between people due to manner or words said
* **Ghosting**: consistent missed deadlines or lack of contribution

Your group should decide on a plan of action to deal with each type of conflict. There can be multiple levels to each plan. Involving the instructors can be part of the plan.

Try to be as specific as possible.
* A bad plan for Ghosting: “Talk to the person.” (too vague)
* A better plan for Ghosting: “Elect the team member who is closest with that person to check in with them one-on-one. Based on the conversation, reexamine the tasks currently on that person’s plate and revise if necessary. Affirm that they are coming to the next team meeting. At the next team meeting, every team member will make an effort to include the Ghoster in any team discussions.”

### Course of Action
*What will your group do in order to resolve each type of conflict? (include the levels of escalation)*


The End!
