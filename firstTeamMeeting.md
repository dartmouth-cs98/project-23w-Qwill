## I. Identify a Common Vision
*Youâ€™ve all voted on a common idea and themes. Now is the time to work through your commonalities and find a unifying vision between all of you. Answer the following for each of you.  This is the time to speak your mind.  Be honest with each other.*

### Commonalities
*Who makes up your team?  What are some common things you are interested in? Tell each other about the things you put down on the survey and expand on some of your passions.*
1. We're React fans! 
2. A lot of us haven't done apps but are interested in learning about app development / learning more technical skills
3. We're interested in solving a specific problem -- connecting outside of social media settings and bringing back a personal touch that's been lost in many "communication"/social media applications
4. Combining playfulness / art with CS
5. Pro-addictive vs anti-addictive?

Small Ideas:
- sending drawings / stickers
- upload images
- handwriting correction
- widget on phone background !!!!! 1/2 of phone screen
- Gamifying, new papers, spinning wheel, crafting??
- Cats: people love cats
- simple UI for accessibility
- birthday notification to send a letter 
- ability to print letters
- set send / receive time for letters
- Giving people ideas about what to write?
- several fonts for each letter and used randomly so it's not uncanny comic sans
- possibly put in variable amounts of space

### Inspiration
*What are some things each of you is inspired by?*
1. Neko Atsume the cat game 
2. Webkinz
3. Locket (iPhone widget)
4. Gamification! 
5. Gambling 
    1. Slot Wheel
6. Webkinz Theme 
7. Poptropica

### Problems of Interest
*What problems are you looking to address? Why?*
1. Finding genuine and affirming (rather than anxiety/doom-scroll-causing) ways to connect using / through technology
2. Creating an app that combines handwriting-to-text, electronic communication, and good aesthetics, without a paywall
3. We want to make something that's compelling and easy to use on a regular basis, but not "addictive" or predatory -- models that get you to scroll and scroll to see more ads 
4. Instantaneous gratification vs the message being sent with some sort of delay...? or a length of letter? archive?
5. Set send time? Like BeReal, mailman only comes once a day, etc etc
6. Making custom font

### Identify
*Which of the above is most interesting to all of you?*

## II. Narrow In
